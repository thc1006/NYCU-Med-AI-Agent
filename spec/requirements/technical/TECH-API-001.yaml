requirement:
  description: |
    The system shall implement a FastAPI-based REST API architecture with async
    capabilities, comprehensive error handling, request validation, and Taiwan-localized
    responses. The API must support high concurrency for medical consultation services.

  rationale: |
    FastAPI provides excellent performance, type safety, automatic API documentation,
    and async support necessary for handling concurrent medical consultation requests
    with proper validation and error handling.

  assumptions:
    - Python 3.11+ runtime environment
    - Async/await programming model
    - Pydantic for data validation
    - httpx for external API calls
    - pytest for comprehensive testing

  constraints:
    - Must maintain backward compatibility
    - Response time requirements for medical APIs
    - Memory efficiency for concurrent requests
    - Proper error handling for medical safety

  dependencies:
    - "PDPA-COLLECT-001" # Personal data handling compliance
    - "TW-EMERGENCY-001" # Taiwan emergency service integration
    - "MS-EMERGENCY-001" # Medical safety requirements

  scenarios:
    - id: "AC-TECH-API-001-001"
      title: "API health check endpoint"
      given: "FastAPI application is running"
      when: "GET /healthz request is made"
      then: |
        Response returns 200 status with:
        • {"status": "ok", "timestamp": "ISO8601", "version": "1.0.0"}
        • X-Request-Id header present
        • Response time < 100ms

    - id: "AC-TECH-API-001-002"
      title: "Request validation and error handling"
      given: "Invalid request payload is sent"
      when: "API endpoint receives malformed data"
      then: |
        Response returns 422 status with:
        • Clear error message in Traditional Chinese
        • Field-specific validation errors
        • Request ID for tracking
        • No sensitive data leaked

    - id: "AC-TECH-API-001-003"
      title: "Taiwan-localized API responses"
      given: "Any API endpoint is called"
      when: "Response is generated"
      then: |
        Response includes:
        • locale: "zh-TW"
        • Emergency numbers in Traditional Chinese
        • Culturally appropriate error messages
        • Proper Traditional Chinese encoding

  performance_criteria:
    response_time: "< 200ms for 95% of health check requests"
    throughput: "1000 concurrent requests"
    availability: "99.9% uptime"
