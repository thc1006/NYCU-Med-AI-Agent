requirement:
  description: |
    The system shall provide location-based search functionality to find nearby hospitals,
    clinics, and medical facilities using Google Places API with Taiwan-specific
    localization and integration with National Health Insurance Administration data.

  rationale: |
    Quick access to nearby medical facilities is essential for users seeking healthcare,
    especially in emergency situations. Taiwan-localized results ensure accuracy
    and cultural relevance.

  assumptions:
    - Google Places API is available and properly configured
    - User location can be determined via IP geolocation or manual input
    - National Health Insurance Administration data is accessible
    - Internet connectivity is available

  constraints:
    - Must use Google Places API with zh-TW language settings
    - Must respect API rate limits and costs
    - Must handle offline/degraded scenarios gracefully
    - Geographic scope limited to Taiwan region

  dependencies:
    - "TW-LOCALIZATION-001" # Taiwan localization requirements
    - "FR-GEOCODING-001" # Address and location processing
    - "PDPA-LOCATION-001" # Location data handling

acceptance_criteria:
  scenarios:
    - id: "AC-FR-SEARCH-001-001"
      title: "Search by current location"
      given: |
        User's location is determined (lat: 25.0330, lng: 121.5654 - Taipei)
      when: |
        User requests nearby hospitals within 3km radius
      then: |
        System returns list of hospitals with Traditional Chinese names, addresses,
        contact information, and NHIA contract status

    - id: "AC-FR-SEARCH-001-002"
      title: "Search by address input"
      given: |
        User inputs Taiwan address "台北市信義區信義路五段7號"
      when: |
        System performs geocoding and hospital search
      then: |
        System geocodes address to coordinates and returns nearby medical facilities
        sorted by distance with emergency service availability

    - id: "AC-FR-SEARCH-001-003"
      title: "NHIA integration verification"
      given: |
        Google Places returns hospital results
      when: |
        System cross-references with NHIA database
      then: |
        Results include is_contracted field and NHIA institution codes where available
