## SPARC Specification Phase

The Specification phase establishes the foundation for all development:
- **Clear, measurable requirements**
- **Taiwan localization (zh-TW, 119/110/112/113/165)**
- **Medical safety priorities**
- **PDPA compliance**
- **TDD-ready acceptance criteria**

## Requirements Management

### Quality Standards
- All requirements must be **testable** and **measurable**
- Each requirement has clear **acceptance criteria**
- **Edge cases** and **error conditions** documented
- **Medical safety** takes absolute priority
- **Taiwan localization** is mandatory

### Traceability
- Requirements → Tests → Implementation
- Bidirectional traceability maintained
- Change impact analysis
- Coverage reporting

## Usage

1. Create requirements using templates in `templates/`
2. Validate using `validation/spec-requirements-validator`
3. Store by category in appropriate subdirectory
4. Maintain traceability through implementation
