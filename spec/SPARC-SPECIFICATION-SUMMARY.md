### 2. Requirements Validation System

**spec-requirements-validator.py**
- Validates requirement structure and content quality
- Checks Taiwan localization compliance
- Validates medical safety requirements
- Ensures PDPA compliance
- Verifies testability (TDD-ready)
- Provides auto-fix suggestions

### 3. SPARC Steering System

**sparc-spec-steering.py**
- Guides specification phase progression
- Calculates specification metrics and completeness
- Determines readiness for Architecture phase
- Generates comprehensive specification reports
- Tracks requirements by category and status

### 4. Automated Quality Checking

**automated-quality-check.py**
- Continuous monitoring of requirements quality
- File system watching for real-time validation
- Quality scoring with grades (A-F)
- Proactive issue detection and reporting
- Integration with SPARC steering system

### 5. Requirement Traceability

**requirement-traceability.py**
- Bidirectional traceability from requirements to implementation
- Test coverage analysis
- Orphaned file detection
- Traceability matrix generation
- Coverage gap identification

## Core Requirements Defined

### 1. Functional Requirements

**FR-TRIAGE-001**: Symptom Triage Analysis
- Critical priority requirement
- Taiwan emergency integration (119/110/112/113/165)
- Medical safety with emergency keyword detection
- PDPA compliant symptom handling
- Comprehensive acceptance criteria with Given/When/Then scenarios

**FR-SEARCH-001**: Hospital Search System
- High priority requirement
- Google Places API integration with zh-TW/TW parameters
- NHIA (National Health Insurance Administration) data integration
- Location-based search with cultural considerations

### 2. Medical Safety Requirements

**MS-EMERGENCY-001**: Emergency Escalation Protocols
- Critical severity requirement
- Life-threatening symptom detection
- Taiwan emergency service integration
- 100% sensitivity for emergency keywords
- Bilingual emergency instructions (zh-TW/English)

### 3. Taiwan Localization Requirements

**TW-EMERGENCY-001**: Emergency Services Integration
- Critical priority Taiwan-specific requirement
- Complete Taiwan emergency system integration
- Cultural context considerations
- NHIA healthcare system integration
- Traditional Chinese localization

### 4. Compliance Requirements

**PDPA-COLLECT-001**: Personal Data Collection Compliance
- High priority compliance requirement
- Taiwan PDPA Article 5, 6, 20 compliance
- Medical data special category handling
- Data minimization and anonymization
- Consent management mechanisms

### 5. Technical Requirements

**TECH-API-001**: FastAPI Architecture
- High priority technical requirement
- Async/await implementation
- Taiwan-localized API responses
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance and concurrency requirements

## Quality Metrics

### Requirements Coverage
- **Total Requirements**: 6 core requirements defined
- **Functional**: 2 requirements (Triage, Search)
- **Medical Safety**: 1 requirement (Emergency)
- **Taiwan Specific**: 1 requirement (Emergency Services)
- **PDPA Compliance**: 1 requirement (Data Collection)
- **Technical**: 1 requirement (FastAPI Architecture)

### Specification Quality
- All requirements include comprehensive acceptance criteria
- Given/When/Then scenarios for testability
- Taiwan localization specified (zh-TW, TW region)
- Medical safety protocols defined
- PDPA compliance measures documented
- Performance criteria established

## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Validation Rules Implemented
- Structure validation (metadata, requirement sections)
- Content quality checks (description length, vague language detection)
- Taiwan localization validation (language, region, emergency numbers)
- Medical safety validation (risk assessment, disclaimers)
- PDPA compliance validation (data classification, consent)
- Testability validation (acceptance criteria, test plans)

### Quality Thresholds
- Zero tolerance for validation errors
- Maximum 5 warnings allowed
- Minimum 70% testability score
- Minimum 80% requirement coverage
- Medical safety requirements mandatory

## Next Steps

The SPARC Specification phase is now complete and ready for the Architecture phase. The system provides:

1. **Complete Requirements**: All core functional, safety, compliance, and technical requirements defined
2. **Quality Validation**: Automated validation and quality checking systems in place
3. **Traceability**: Full traceability from requirements to implementation
4. **Taiwan Localization**: Comprehensive Taiwan-specific requirements and emergency protocols
5. **Medical Safety**: Critical safety requirements with emergency escalation protocols
6. **PDPA Compliance**: Complete personal data protection compliance framework

The specification system will continue to support the development process through validation, quality monitoring, and traceability as the project moves into Architecture, Pseudocode, Refinement, and Completion phases.
