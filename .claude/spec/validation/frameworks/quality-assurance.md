# Quality Assurance Framework
## Medical Safety Compliance for Taiwan AI Agent

### Overview
This framework ensures medical AI designs meet Taiwan's healthcare standards, safety protocols, and legal compliance requirements before implementation.

### Medical Safety Standards

#### Emergency Response Compliance
- **Taiwan Emergency Numbers**: All designs must include 119, 110, 112, 113, 165
- **Priority Protocols**: Life-threatening symptoms trigger immediate 119 guidance
- **Escalation Pathways**: Clear progression from self-care to emergency intervention
- **Response Time Targets**: Emergency triage responses within 2 seconds

#### Clinical Safety Boundaries
- **No Diagnostic Claims**: System provides information, not medical diagnosis
- **Professional Referral**: All conditions require healthcare professional consultation
- **Disclaimer Requirements**: Medical liability and system limitation statements
- **Evidence-Based Information**: All medical content sourced from authoritative sources

#### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Level | Symptoms | Response | Timeline |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Critical | Chest pain, difficulty breathing, paralysis | Immediate 119 + nearest emergency | <2 seconds |
| High | Severe pain, fever >39Â°C, bleeding | Urgent care + medical consultation | <5 seconds |
| Medium | Persistent symptoms, moderate pain | Medical appointment within 24-48hrs | <10 seconds |
| Low | Minor symptoms, general questions | Self-care guidance + monitoring | <15 seconds |
