# Design Validation Framework
## Taiwan Medical AI Agent - Technical Design Validation

### Overview
This framework provides comprehensive validation for technical design documents in the Taiwan Medical AI Agent project, ensuring technical soundness, completeness, and compliance before user review.

### Validation Layers

#### 1. Template Compliance Validation
- **Structure Verification**: Ensure all required template sections are present
- **Format Compliance**: Verify document follows exact template structure
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Check required diagrams are present and properly formatted
- **Missing Sections**: Identify incomplete or missing template sections

#### 2. Technical Soundness Validation
- **Architecture Quality**: System design is logical and well-defined
- **Component Relationships**: Clear and properly diagrammed relationships
- **Database Schema**: Normalized and efficient design
- **API Design**: RESTful principles and existing pattern compliance
- **Integration Points**: Defined integration with current systems

#### 3. Medical Safety Compliance
- **Emergency Protocols**: Taiwan-specific emergency numbers (119, 110, 112, 113, 165)
- **Medical Disclaimers**: Required disclaimer and emergency guidance
- **Risk Assessment**: Proper symptom triage and emergency detection
- **Professional Boundaries**: No diagnostic statements, referral to professionals

#### 4. Taiwan Localization Compliance
- **Language Requirements**: zh-TW language compliance
- **Regional Standards**: Taiwan-specific medical and legal requirements
- **Emergency Services**: Correct Taiwan emergency contact information
- **Healthcare System**: Integration with Taiwan's healthcare infrastructure

#### 5. Privacy & Legal Compliance
- **PDPA Compliance**: Personal Data Protection Act requirements
- **Data Minimization**: Minimal necessary data collection principles
- **Audit Logging**: Proper audit trail without sensitive data
- **User Rights**: Data subject rights implementation

#### 6. Technical Standards Compliance
- **Tech Stack Alignment**: FastAPI, Python 3.11, httpx, pytest compliance
- **Testing Strategy**: TDD principles and comprehensive test coverage
- **Security Considerations**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance Requirements**: Scalability and response time considerations

### Validation Process

#### Automated Checks
1. **Template Structure**: Compare against design-template.md
2. **Requirements Coverage**: Verify all requirements.md items addressed
3. **Code Standards**: Tech stack and pattern compliance
4. **Medical Safety**: Emergency protocol and disclaimer validation
5. **Localization**: zh-TW and Taiwan-specific compliance

#### Manual Review Points
1. **Architecture Feasibility**: Implementability assessment
2. **Integration Strategy**: Leverage existing systems effectively
3. **Maintenance Complexity**: Long-term sustainability
4. **Performance Implications**: System performance impact

### Validation Results

#### Rating System
- **PASS**: Design is complete, technically sound, and ready for implementation
- **NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT**: Minor issues requiring attention before implementation
- **MAJOR_ISSUES**: Significant problems requiring redesign or major revisions

#### Feedback Structure
- **Overall Rating**: PASS/NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT/MAJOR_ISSUES
- **Template Compliance Issues**: Missing sections, format problems
- **Requirements Coverage Issues**: Unaddressed requirements
- **Technical Issues**: Architecture, security, performance concerns
- **Compliance Gaps**: Medical safety, localization, privacy issues
- **Integration Gaps**: Missing leverage opportunities
- **Documentation Issues**: Missing diagrams, unclear explanations
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Specific actionable recommendations
- **Strengths**: Well-designed aspects

### Integration with Development Workflow

#### Pre-Implementation Validation
- All design documents must pass validation before implementation begins
- Validation results stored in memory with key pattern: `spec/validation/[feature-name]/[timestamp]`
- Failed validations block implementation until resolved

#### Continuous Validation
- Design changes trigger automatic re-validation
- Validation hooks monitor file changes in specs directory
- Real-time feedback during design iterations

#### Quality Gates
- Template compliance: 100% required sections present
- Requirements coverage: 100% requirements addressed
- Medical safety: All emergency protocols and disclaimers present
- Technical feasibility: Reviewer approval required
- Privacy compliance: PDPA requirements validated

### Tools and Automation

#### Validation Scripts
- `validate-design.js`: Automated design document validation
- `check-template-compliance.js`: Template structure verification
- `verify-requirements-coverage.js`: Requirements mapping validation
- `validate-medical-safety.js`: Medical safety protocol checker

#### Integration Hooks
- Pre-edit hooks: Validate before design changes
- Post-edit hooks: Immediate validation feedback
- Session hooks: Comprehensive validation summaries

#### Reporting
- Validation reports stored in `.claude/spec/validation/reports/`
- Trend analysis of common validation failures
- Improvement recommendations based on patterns
